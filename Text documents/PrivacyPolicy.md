# Privacy Policy

This app collects basic information about you:

Username

Password (encrypted)

Acceptance of Terms of Service (ToS) and Privacy Policy

These are required so the app can support multiple users and track movies for each user, giving each user a personalized movie list.

Passwords are stored encrypted.

Your information will not be shared with third parties (note: all files are public because this is a school project).

Users can withdraw consent at any time; doing so will prevent access to the app.

User data is deleted upon account deletion.

Users must accept the ToS and Privacy Policy when creating an account.
